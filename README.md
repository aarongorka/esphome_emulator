# ESPHome Emulator

Pretend to be an ESPHome device with a Python script.

## Why?

Just for fun and to learn protobuf and sockets in Python.

## Limitations

  * No encryption
  * No authentication
  * No discovery
  * Doesn't handle multiple clients
  * Doesn't integrate with ESPHome dashboard/server, only Home Assistant
  * Only implements sending of sensor data
